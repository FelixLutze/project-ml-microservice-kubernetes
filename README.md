## Operationalize a Scaling Machine Learning Microservice API

This project aims to display my skills in deploying and scaling microservices with Docker and Kubernetes.

## Project Tasks from <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-dev-ops-nanodegree--nd9991">Udacity</a>

Your project goal is to operationalize this working, machine learning microservice using kubernetes, which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. In this project you will:

* Test your project code using linting
* Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
* Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested

## Setup the Environment

* Clone the Repository with `git clone https://github.com/FelixLutze/project-ml-microservice-kubernetes`
* Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv ~/.devops`
* Activate the virtual environment: `source ~/.devops/bin/activate`
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies
* Install Minikube as show <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/">here</a>
